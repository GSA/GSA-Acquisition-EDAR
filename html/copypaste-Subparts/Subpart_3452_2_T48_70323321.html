                                 <p class="p List2">(1) The Regulations define research as “a systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.” (34 CFR 97.102(l)). If an activity follows a deliberate plan designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge, it is research. Research includes activities that meet this definition, whether or not they are conducted under a program considered research for other purposes. For example, some demonstration and service programs may include research activities (34 CFR 97.102(l)).
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) The Regulations define a human subject as a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains data through intervention or interaction with the individual or obtains, uses, studies, analyzes, or generates identifiable private information. (34 CFR 97.102(e)(1)). Under this definition:
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) The investigator gathers information about a living person through—
</p>
                                 <p class="p List4">(A) Intervention—Manipulating the subject's environment for research purposes, as might occur when a new instructional technique is tested; or
</p>
                                 <p class="p List4">(B) Interaction—Communicating or interacting with the individual, as occurs with surveys and interviews.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) Identifiable private information is private information about a living person that can be linked to that individual (the identity of the subject is or may be readily ascertained by the investigator or associated with the information).
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iii) Private information includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information that has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and that an individual can reasonably expect will not be made public (for example, a school health record).
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(c) Exemptions. 34 CFR 97.104(d) provides exemptions from the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects for research activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will be in one or more of the categories set forth in 34 CFR 97.104(d). However, if the research subjects are children, the exemption at 34 CFR 97.104(d)(2) (<em class="ph i">i.e.,</em> research involving the use of educational tests, survey procedures, interview procedures or observation of public behavior) is modified by 34 CFR 97.401(b), as explained in paragraph (d) of this provision.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(d) Children as research subjects. 34 CFR 97.402(a) defines children as “persons who have not attained the legal age for consent to interventions or procedures involved in the research, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the research will be conducted.” 34 CFR 97.401(b) provides that, if the research involves children as subjects—
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) The exemption in 34 CFR 97.104(d)(2) does not apply to activities involving—
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) Survey or interview procedures involving children as subjects; or
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) Observations of public behavior of children in which the investigator or investigators will not participate in the activities being observed.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) The exemption in 34 CFR 97.104(d)(2) continues to apply, unmodified, by 34 CFR 97.401(b), to—
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) Educational tests; and
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) Observations of public behavior in which the investigator or investigators will not participate in the activities being observed.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(e) Proposal Instructions. An offeror proposing to do research that involves human subjects must provide information to the Department on the proposed exempt and nonexempt research activities. The offeror should submit this information as an attachment to its technical proposal. No specific page limitation applies to this requirement, but the offeror should be brief and to the point.

         <p class="p P">As prescribed in 3424.170, insert the following clause in any contract that includes research activities involving human subjects covered under 34 CFR part 97:
</p>
                                 <p class="p HD1">Research Activities Involving Human Subjects (OCT 2023)
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(a) In accordance with Department of Education (the “Department”) regulations on the protection of human subjects in research, title 34, Code of Federal Regulations, part 97 (the Regulations), Contractors and subcontractors engaged in covered (nonexempt) research activities shall establish and maintain procedures for the protection of human subjects. The Contractor must include the substance of this clause in all subcontracts. In addition, the Contractor shall notify other entities (known to the Contractor) engaged in the covered research activities of their responsibility to comply with the regulations. The definitions in 34 CFR 97.102 apply to this clause. As used in this clause, “covered research” means research involving human subjects that is not exempt under 34 CFR 97.104 and 97.401(b).
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(b) If the Department determines that proposed research activities involving human subjects are covered (<em class="ph i">i.e.,</em> not exempt under the regulations), the Contracting Officer (CO) or Contacting Officer's Representative (COR) will require the Contractor to apply for the Federal Wide Assurance from the Office for Human Research Protections, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, if the Contractor does not already have certification on file. The CO will also require that the Contractor obtain and send to the Department documentation of Institutional Review Board (IRB) review and approval of the proposed research.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(c) Under no condition shall the Contractor conduct, or allow to be conducted, any research activity involving human subjects prior to the Department's receipt of the certification that the proposed research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB (34 CFR 97.103(f)). No research involving human subjects shall be initiated under this contract until the Contractor has provided the CO (or the COR) a properly completed certification form certifying IRB review and approval of the research activity, and the CO or COR has acknowledged the receipt of such certification.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(d) In accordance with 34 CFR 97.109(f)(1), unless IRB or the Department determines otherwise, continuing review of research is not required in the following conditions:
</p>
                                 <p class="p P">1. Research is eligible for expedited review;
</p>
                                 <p class="p P">2. Research is reviewed by the IRB in accordance with the limited IRB review as described 34 CFR 97.104(d)(2)(iii); or
</p>
                                 <p class="p P">3. Research that is part of the IRB-approved study that has progressed to the point that it involves only one or both of the following:
</p>
                                 <p class="p P">i. data analysis, including analysis of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, or
</p>
                                 <p class="p P">ii. accessing follow-up clinical data from interventions that subjects would undergo as part of clinical care.

				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			For each activity under this contract that requires continuing review, the Contractor shall submit an annual written representation to the CO or COR stating whether research activities have been reviewed and approved by the IRB within the previous 12 months. The Contractor may use the form titled “U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Subpart C Certification Form” for this representation. For multi-institutional projects, the Contractor shall provide this representation on its behalf and on behalf of any subcontractor engaged in research activities for which continuing IRB reviews are required.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(2) If the IRB disapproves, suspends, terminates, or requires modification of any research activities under this contract, the Contractor shall immediately notify the CO in writing of the IRB's action.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(e) The Contractor shall bear full responsibility for performing, as safely as is feasible, all activities under this contract involving the use of human subjects and for complying with all applicable regulations and requirements concerning human subjects. Neither the Contractor, subcontractor, agents of the Contractor, or employees of the Contractor, nor any person, organization, institution, or group of any kind involved in the performance of such activities under this contract, shall be deemed to constitute an agent or employee of the Department or of the Federal government with respect to such activities. The Contractor agrees to discharge its obligations, duties, and undertakings and the work pursuant thereto, whether requiring professional judgment or otherwise, as an independent contractor without imputing liability on the part of the Government for the acts of the Contractor, subcontractor, or their employees.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(f) Upon discovery of any noncompliance with any of the requirements or standards as stated in this clause, the Contractor shall correct such noncompliance as soon as practicable, typically no later than 1 business day. If the CO determines, in consultation with the Protection of Human Subjects Coordinator, Office of Acquisition, Grants, and Risk Management, Office of Finance and Operations, or the sponsoring office, that the Contractor is not in compliance with the requirements or standards stated in this clause, the CO may suspend work under this contract, in whole or in part, until it is determined that the Contractor has corrected such noncompliance and the CO authorizes the continuation of work.
</p>
                                 <p class="p P">1. Initial notice of suspension. The initial notice of suspension under this clause may be communicated orally or in writing by the CO.
</p>
                                 <p class="p P">2. Notice of suspension of work. The CO shall provide written notice of suspension of work under this clause. The notice shall contain the following:
</p>
                                 <p class="p P">a. The effective date of suspension of work.
</p>
                                 <p class="p P">b. The requirements and/or standards for which the Contractor is out of compliance.
</p>
                                 <p class="p P">c. Any special instructions for the suspension of work.
</p>
                                 <p class="p P">3. Authorization to resume work. If the CO determines that the noncompliance has been remedied and it is in the best interest of the Government, the CO may authorize work to resume under the contract. The CO will provide written notice to the Contractor of such authorization.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(g) Non-compliance with the requirements or standards as stated in this clause may result in the Government termination of this contract for default, in full or in part, in accordance with FAR 49.401. Such termination may be in lieu of or in addition to suspension of work under the contract. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the Government's right to terminate the contract for failure to fully comply with such requirements or standards.

Additional funds are intended to be allotted to the applicable CLIN(s) by contract modification up to and including the full price of the entire period of performance. This notwithstanding, the Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor for amounts payable in excess of the amount actually allotted, nor will the Contractor be obligated to perform in excess of such amount.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(a) The CLIN(s) in paragraph (l) of this clause is/are incrementally funded. Paragraph (l) also lists the allotment amount presently available for payment and allotted to the CLIN(s), inclusive of any termination costs for the Government's convenience, and the allotment schedule that provides the last date of Contractor performance for which it is estimated the allotted amount will cover. The parties contemplate that the Government may allot additional funds incrementally to the applicable CLIN(s) under the contract, up to the full price specified in the contract. The Contractor agrees to perform work under the applicable CLIN(s) up to the point at which the total amount paid and payable by the Government under the contract for the applicable CLIN(s), including estimated costs in the event of termination of those CLIN(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount currently allotted to such CLIN(s).
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(b) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (l) of this clause, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least ninety (90) days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for the Government's convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable CLIN(s). The notification will state 
				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			the estimated date when that point will be reached, and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable CLIN(s) up to the date in paragraph (l) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(c) If, after notification pursuant to paragraph (b) of this clause, additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in paragraph (l), the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed substitute date, upon the Contractor's written request, the Contracting Officer may terminate for the Government's convenience any CLIN(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted. If the Contractor estimates that the funds available will allow it to continue to discharge its obligations beyond that date, it may specify a later date in its request to terminate the applicable CLIN(s), and the Contracting Officer may terminate such CLIN(s) on that later date. In no event is the Contractor authorized to continue work on those CLIN(s) beyond the time when the amount payable, to include costs of termination for the Government's convenience, is equal to the funds allotted.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(d) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated in paragraph (l) of this clause, in amounts sufficient for timely performance of the CLIN(s) identified in paragraph (l) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, the Contractor may request an equitable adjustment to the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices, where applicable) of the applicable CLIN(s), or in the time of delivery, or both, by written request to the Contacting Officer with sufficient documentation to support such equitable adjustment. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause titled “Disputes.” Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event will an equitable adjustment under this paragraph (d) be due to the Contractor for costs that arise from or relate to the Contractor's breach of the notification obligations in paragraph (b) of this clause.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(e) Except as required by other provisions of this contract, specifically citing and stated to be an exception to this clause—
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) The Government is not obligated to pay for goods or services, to include reimbursement of costs for termination for the Government's convenience, in excess of the total amount allotted by the Government to the CLIN(s) identified in paragraph (l) of this clause; and
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) The Contractor is not authorized to continue performance of the CLIN(s) identified in paragraph (l) of this clause in excess of the amount allotted by the Government to the applicable CLIN(s).
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable CLIN(s) for convenience includes reasonable costs, profit, and termination settlement costs for those item(s).
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(f) No communication or representation in any form other than in writing from the Contracting Officer shall affect the amount allotted by the Government to this contract and applicable CLIN(s). The Government is not obligated to reimburse the Contractor for any costs in excess of the total amount allotted by the Government to the applicable CLIN(s), whether incurred during the course of the contract or as a result of termination.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(g) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the CLIN(s) identified in paragraph (l) of this clause.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(h) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the CLIN(s) identified in paragraph (l) of this clause, the parties will agree as to the period of contract performance that will be covered by the funds. The provisions of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(i) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, for cause in the event of any breach or default by the Contractor. The provisions of this clause are limited to the work and allotment of funds for the CLIN(s) set forth in paragraph (l) of this clause. This clause no longer applies once the contract is fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments negotiated under paragraph (d) of this clause.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(j) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract, in whole or in part, for convenience or cause.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(k) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342.

</p>

</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(a) The contractor and its subcontractors shall comply with Department security policy requirements as set forth in the “Bidder's Security Package: Security Requirements for Contractors Doing Business with the Department of Education” at <em class="ph i">http://www.ed.gov/fund/contract/about/bsp.html.</em>
                                 </p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(b) The following are the contractor employee positions required under this contract and their designated risk levels:
</p>
                                 <p class="p P">High Risk (HR): [Specify HR positions.]

                                 <p class="p P">Moderate Risk (MR): [Specify MR positions.]

Personnel security screenings will be commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm the individual could cause.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(d) The contractor shall -

</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) Ensure that no contractor employee is placed in a higher risk position than that for which he or she was previously approved, without the approval of the contracting officer or the COR, the Department personnel security officer, and the Department computer security officer.

                                 <p class="p List2">(6) Report to the COR all instances of individuals seeking to obtain unauthorized access to any departmental IT system, or sensitive but unclassified and/or Privacy Act protected information.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(7) Report to the COR any information that raises an issue as to whether a contractor employee's eligibility for continued employment or access to Department IT systems, or sensitive but unclassified and/or Privacy Act protected information, promotes the efficiency of the service or violates the public trust.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(10) Abide by the requirements in Departmental Directive OM:5-101, “Contractor Employee Personnel Security Screenings.”
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(e) Further information including definitions of terms used in this clause and a list of required investigative forms for each risk designation are contained in Departmental Directive OM:5-101, “Contractor Employee Personnel Security Screenings” available at the Web site listed in the first paragraph of this clause.

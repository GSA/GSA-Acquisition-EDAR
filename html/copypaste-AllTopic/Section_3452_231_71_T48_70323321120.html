The cost of invitational travel under this contract not identified in the consent section of this clause is unallowable unless the Contractor receives written consent from the Contracting Officer prior to the incurrence of the cost. If the Contractor wishes to be reimbursed for a cost related to invitational travel, a request must be in writing at least 21 days prior to the day that costs would be incurred. The Contractor must include in its request the following: why the invitational travel cost is integral to fulfill a Government requirement in the contract, and the proposed cost that must be in accordance with Federal Travel Regulations. The lack of a timely response from the Contracting Officer must not constitute constructive acceptance of the allowability of the proposed charge.
